  <h2>Font Families</h2>

  <p>The CSS font-family attribute determines which typeface is used. Standard typefaces, such as Courier, Arial, Helvetica, and Georgia can be specified, or generic font styles can be used. Acceptable font styles are serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy.</p>

  <p>Multiple typefaces can be specified for an element and should be separated by commas. If using a font that contains whitespace, the name of that typeface should be in quotes. The font listed first will take priority. If the browser cannot find that font installed on the computer, it will fall to the second option, if the second cannot be fount it will look for the third, etc. If none of the fonts specified can be found the browser's default font family will be used.</p>

  <p>It is best practices to end the list of font options with a generic typeface so that you are not relying on the browser's default font. It is also important to be mindful of which fonts are available on which operating systems. For example, Mac computers have the Helvetica font but Windows computers usually do not, and so Arial may be used as a substitute.</p>

  <p>
  Example:<br>
  <code>body {<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;<br>
  }</code>

  <h2>WEB-SAFE FONTS</h2>

  <p>These are fonts that work on most computers. If a web-safe font is either your specified font or one of your fallbacks -- fonts the computer displays if the first font specified is not available on the computer -- your webpages will display correctly on the majority of computers.</p>

  <p>Examples of fonts that exist on most computer systems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Arial</li>
    <li>Helvetica</li>
    <li>Times</li>
    <li>Times New Roman</li>
    <li>Courier New</li>
    <li>Courier</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With mobile devices, however, the list of web-safe fonts is far smaller.</p>
