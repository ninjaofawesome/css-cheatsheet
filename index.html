      <h2>Font Style</h2>

      <p>The font-style CSS property allows you to select italic or oblique font-faces within your chosen font family.</p>

      <p>Italic forms are generally cursive, while oblique forms are generally sloped.</p>

      <p>Values:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>normal: selects a font that is classified as normal</li>
        <li>italic: selects an italic form; if that is not available, selects an oblique form</li>
        <li>oblique: selects an oblique form</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example syntax:</p>

      <p>p { font-style: italic }</p>

      <h2>Web-Safe Fonts</h2>

      <p>These are fonts that work on most computers. If a web-safe font is either your specified font or one of your fallbacks -- fonts the computer displays if the first font specified is not available on the computer -- your webpages will display correctly on the majority of computers.</p>

      <p>The complete list of web-safe fonts can be found here: <a href="http://cssfontstack.com/">CSS Font Stack</a>.</p>

      <p>With mobile devices, however, the list of web-safe fonts is far smaller, at least according to <a href="http://www.bluetrainmobile.com/blog/choosing-fonts-for-your-mobile-website/">this website</a>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Arial/Helvetica</li>
        <li>Courier/Courier New</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Times/Times New Roman</li>
        <li>Trebuchet MS</li>
        <li>Verdana</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you want to use a font that isn't on the list of web-safe fonts, you can use one of the tools we discuss below.</p>

	<h1>Font Support</h1>

	<p>When declaring a font family to use on a site, the family of fonts is chosen in a heiarchy.  The first choice font will be listed first (it could be an included font), followed by the next choice if that font does not want to render, followed by more choices, then followed by a final choice available to most computers everywhere.</p>

	<p>The two most general families of fonts to choose from are serif fonts or sans-serif fonts.  Beyond that there are a small variety of web safe fonts to choose from.  (Please refer to <a href = "http://cssfontstack.com/">this page</a> for a full listing.)  The designer can then choose their first choice of fonts by using the @font-face rule in most browsers today.</p>
