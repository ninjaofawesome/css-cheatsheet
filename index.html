	<p>When declaring a font family to use on a site, the family of fonts is chosen in a heiarchy.  The first choice font will be listed first (it could be an included font), followed by the next choice if that font does not want to render, followed by more choices, then followed by a final choice available to most computers everywhere.</p>

	<p>The two most general families of fonts to choose from are serif fonts or sans-serif fonts.  Beyond that there are a small variety of web safe fonts to choose from.  (Please refer to <a href = "http://cssfontstack.com/">this page</a> for a full listing.)  The designer can then choose their first choice of fonts by using the @font-face rule in most browsers today.</p>
